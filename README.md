Welcome to the Fun Calculator – a simple yet enthusiastic command-line calculator built with Python! This program allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers with a bit of personality thrown in. 🤓✨

💡 What It Does
This calculator performs four basic arithmetic operations:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division

All results are printed in a friendly, easy-to-read format.

🧰 How It Works
The user is prompted to enter two numbers (decimals are allowed!).

The program calculates the:

Sum

Difference

Product

Quotient

All results are displayed with clear labels and fun commentary.

📝 Sample Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
⚠️ Note on Division
This program does not include error handling for division by zero. If you enter 0 as the second number, Python will raise a ZeroDivisionError. Please be responsible! 😅

🚀 Getting Started

✨ Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
Add error handling for division by zero.

Allow multiple operations without restarting.

Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.

Include operation selection (user picks what to calculate).
